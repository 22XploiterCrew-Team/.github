We are an Information Technology community focused on security, we can also be called a hacker group from Indonesia. We founded this community in ***May 2019*** with the aim of doing penetration testing or looking for security holes in websites or applications.
<br/>
The number of our team members is only a maximum of 22 people and each member has different abilities or expertise in their fields, among others are:

- Bug Hunter
- Defacer
- Programmer

Each of us complements the other in terms of expertise.

## The origins of the formation of this team

In 2019, to be precise in May, there was a massive demonstration 🤯 in Indonesia. Members of this team were formerly part of the famous Indonesian team, the ***Indonesian Cyber ​​Fighter***. Many people say this team was formed because of the demonstration at the time, but in fact we formed this team only for penetration testing of websites or applications.
<br/>
Maybe this is the only explanation I can give, because I am also not a member who helped build this team since its inception.

## The people who founded it

The following are some of the people who founded this community:

- cr0t_did4l3m
- ./Hirarukun
- Parkerzanta

Now the 2 founders have left the community due to important business in their real world, The team is now led by Parkerzanta and assisted by RandsX.
